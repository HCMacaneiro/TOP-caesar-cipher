## 🛠 What’s a Caesar Cipher?

A **Caesar Cipher** shifts each letter in your text by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. It's like giving your words a secret handshake! For example, with a **right shift of 3**:  
- `A` becomes `D`  
- `B` becomes `E`  
- `Z` wraps around to `C`  

Non-alphabetic characters like spaces, numbers, and symbols? Don’t worry—they stay just the way they are.
